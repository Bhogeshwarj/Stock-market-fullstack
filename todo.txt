To create a backend for your Next.js stock/money management app using industry-standard techniques, you can follow a RESTful API or GraphQL API architecture, depending on your needs, while leveraging modern tools and best practices.

Recommended Stack for Backend
Node.js with Express or Fastify:

Express: A popular, minimalist web framework for building RESTful APIs.
Fastify: Similar to Express but optimized for speed.
Either of these can handle API routes, business logic, and communication with the database.

TypeScript:

Adding TypeScript to the backend ensures type safety and reduces bugs in production code. Since you are already using TypeScript for your frontend, it makes sense to use it on the backend too.
MySQL with ORM:

Use Prisma ORM for modern, type-safe database interaction, which works seamlessly with MySQL.
Sequelize is another alternative ORM if Prisma doesnâ€™t meet your needs, but Prisma is more aligned with TypeScript and modern patterns.
Authentication and Authorization:

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for token-based authentication.
For session management, you can use Passport.js or Auth0 for secure authentication management.
Caching Layer:

Use Redis for caching frequently requested data (e.g., stock information) to improve performance.
API Rate Limiting:

Implement rate limiting using tools like express-rate-limit to prevent API abuse, especially for external API requests like fetching stock data.
Docker and Kubernetes:

Dockerize your backend for consistency and scalability, allowing the app to run across different environments.
Use Kubernetes for orchestration in case your app needs to scale horizontally across multiple containers.
Testing:

Use Jest or Mocha for unit testing your backend.
For integration testing, Supertest works well with Express/Fastify to test API routes.
API Documentation:

Automatically generate documentation for your API using Swagger or Postman.
Deployment:

Use platforms like Vercel (for frontend) and AWS/GCP/Heroku (for backend).
Leverage CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate deployment.
Example Architecture
Backend (Node.js + Express + TypeScript):

RESTful or GraphQL API for stock data management, CRUD operations, etc.
Prisma ORM for MySQL interaction.
JWT-based authentication.
Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript):

Fetch data from the backend API for displaying stock information and watchlists.
Leverage server-side rendering (SSR) where needed for SEO (especially for fundamental analysis pages).
Database (MySQL + Prisma):

Watchlist, stock data, user profiles stored in MySQL.
Caching Layer (Redis):

Cache stock data and external API responses for performance improvements.
Tools for CI/CD, Monitoring, and Logging:
CI/CD: Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
Monitoring: Tools like Prometheus with Grafana for backend health and performance monitoring.
Logging: Use Winston for logging server activity, and integrate with LogDNA or Datadog for analysis.
Conclusion:
For a modern, scalable backend, using Node.js with Express (or Fastify), TypeScript, MySQL with Prisma, and adding layers like Re
